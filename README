Simple Open EtherCAT master
http://soem.berlios.de/

SOEM is an EtherCAT (Ethernet for Control Automation Technology) master library written in c. Its purpose is to learn and to use. All users are invited to study the source to get an understanding how an EtherCAT master functions and how it interacts with EtherCAT slaves.

It's primary target system is Linux, all examples are written for it. But as all applications are different, SOEM tries to not impose any design architecture. It can be used in generic user mode, PREEMPT_RT or Xenomai. Also converting it to other targets is relativly simple. For detailed information about EtherCAT vistit the ETG (EtherCAT technology group) site, see the links section below.

=============================================================

To compile for linux:

go to project directory

# source ./setup.sh linux
# make all

Please read the doxygen documentation in doc/html/index.html

--------------------------------------------------------------

To compile for QNX:

go to project directory, use the "dot" operator if source isn't available (it probably isn't). 

# . ./setup.sh qnx
# make all

Please read the doxygen documentation in doc/html/index.html


--------------------------------------------------------------

To compile for windows:

go to project directory 

Build soem libary make_libsoem_lib.bat <Path to MSVC VC> <arch>

Ex: make_libsoem_lib.bat "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC" x86

Build test folder make_test_win32.bat <Path to MSVC VC> <arch>

Ex: make_test_win32.bat "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC" x86

Test: slavinfo.exe <wpcap device name>. sllaveinfo.exe will print the \Device\NPF_{xxxxxx}'s
Ex. slaveinfo.exe \Device\NPF_{735D4B45-68D6-47A6-B826-E0DA26AC761A}
